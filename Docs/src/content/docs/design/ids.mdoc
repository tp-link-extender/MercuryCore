description: Design of unique identifiers used in Mercury Core.

IDs are used throughout Mercury systems to identify a variety of entities. They are essential in any database or service to uniquely identify records, facilitate relationships between entities, and ensure data integrity. This page outlines the design principles and formats for IDs used in Mercury Core.

## String identifiers

The most common type of ID used in Mercury is a 20-character lowercase alphanumeric string. These are the [default random IDs used in SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealql/datamodel/ids#random-ids), as well as when using the [`rand::guid()` function](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealql/functions/database/rand#randid) (soon to be renamed to `rand::id()`) and are used as the primary identifiers for most entities in the system.
An example of such an ID is as follows:

```
a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0
```

In Mercury Core, these types of IDs are most visible in the URLs for comments and groups, place server and private tickets, and registration keys. While not visible for other entities, they are still used as the main identifiers for record lookups, even if other fields are used for display purposes.

With 36 possible characters (26 letters + 10 digits) and a length of 20 characters, there are a total of 36<sup>20</sup> (approximately 1.34 × 10<sup>31</sup>) possible unique IDs. As such, the probability of a collision (two entities receiving the same ID) is low enough to never be of practical concern.

## Numeric identifiers

In addition to string IDs, Mercury Core also uses numeric IDs for certain entities. These are used solely for compatibility with the Client, Studio, or RCCService, and are limited to use in entities that interact with those systems.

In some versions of the Client and Studio, numeric IDs are stored as 32-bit signed integers. As such, the maximum ID value is limited to 2 147 483 647 (2<sup>31</sup> - 1).

	Most Client and Studio API methods expect URL strings instead of numeric IDs, though functions that require numeric IDs are still present. Assets proxied or cached by Mercury Core from Roblox's Open Cloud API may use numeric IDs that exceed the 32-bit signed integer limit. These will cause issues if passed to an API method that requires a numeric ID. When using assets from Open Cloud, watch out for errors caused by their IDs, as they may be interpreted as negative (usually -2 147 483 648) by the Client or Studio.

	Note that the 32-bit limit is not caused by Lua, as all versions of Lua used in Clients and Studios use 64-bit floating point numbers for all numeric values, capable of holding a wider range of distinct integers than a 32-bit integer value. The limitation is purely due to how the Client and Studio API functions handle numeric IDs internally.

	Negative IDs are possible to use in the Client and Studio, and most of the time do send requests to the Site with correctly formatted URLs. Their behaviour can best be described as "strange". We recommend only using positive numeric IDs to avoid any unexpected issues.

Mercury core forces numeric IDs to be between 100 000 000 and 999 999 999 (9 digits) or between 10 000 000 and 99 999 999 (8 digits) to maintain compatibility with these limits. All 8-digit IDs are used for Corescripts and Libraries, and all 9-digit IDs are used for Mercury assets.

Collisions between 8-digit IDs are not a concern as they are statically assigned to Corescripts and Libraries. However, the 9-digit IDs, which are generated randomly with only 9 × 10<sup>8</sup> possible values, are more likely to experience collisions as more assets are created. We accept this risk as a tradeoff to maintain compatibility with the Client and Studio, without incurring the implementation complexity and other risks of using incremental IDs.
