# Mercury website

To begin editing the website, you will need:

- Latest version of NodeJS installed
- Latest version of npm installed
- A terminal
- A modern web browser

Instructions:

- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Open a terminal and navigate to the directory of the repository
- DON'T Run `npm i -g pnpm` to install pnpm. We have been experiencing technical difficulties with pnpm lately, so just use npm for the time being.
- Run `npm i` to install all dependencies.
  
To start a local dev server, run `npm run dev` and navigate to the link shown in the terminal. Upon saving a file, your changes will be shown in the web browser.

To build for production, run `npm run build`, then `npm run preview` to preview the final site.
